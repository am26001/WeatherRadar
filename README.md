## Known Issues
Note that the WeatherRadar application was created on desktop with a display resolution of 2560 x 1440. If there is an issue with content being displayed (current weather details), try zooming in or out. Due to time constraints, the issue was not fixed during the development process. This was meant to be responsive for different devices, however it is to some extent.
