        <li>
          <!-- q -->
          <h2>Can I Rely on your Forecast?</h2>
          <!-- a -->
          <p>Yes! Our weather uses an application programming interface (API) which grabs information from another
            website. Our weather forecast comes from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather</a>
            and our weather radar map comes from <a href="https://www.windy.com/?41.779,-87.779,5">Windy</a>. The
            forecast that is shown is live. The weather radar map can report future forecast by editing what is being
            displayed on screen.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <!-- q -->
          <h2>How can I see the Forecast for a Different Location?</h2>
          <!-- a -->
          <p>With our functional search bar located in the main page on the top right, enter your desired location to
            retrieve the current forecast. After doing so, press the "Enter" key or click the search button to the right
            of the search bar. This will update the main page, assuming you have internet connection. Please note that
            the default location is set to "Chicago".</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <!-- q -->
          <h2>What does the Current Weather Details Results Report?</h2>
          <!-- a -->
          <p>The current weather details show the meteorological conditions of the location that is entered. The
            meteorological conditions reveal the current environmental conditions which can impact the weather. This
            includes the actual temperature, feels like temperature, its low and high, the atmospheric pressure,
            humidity, wind direction, and wind speed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <!-- q -->
          <h2>What does the Atmospheric Pressure Results Report?</h2>
          <!-- a -->
          <p>Atmospheric pressure is the force per unit of area applied on the Earth’s surface. It is simply how strong
            the wind is since it can either exert a lot of pressure or a low amount. Our atmospheric pressure is
            displayed with hPa units. Hectopascal (hPa) is a metric measurement unit of pressure.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <!-- q -->
          <h2>What is Classified as High Atmospheric Pressure?</h2>
          <!-- a -->
          <p>A barometric reading that is over 1022.7 hpa is considered to be high atmospheric pressure, which is
            normally associated with clear skies and tranquil weather.</p>
        </li>
        <!-- q -->
        <h2>What is Classified as Normal Atmospheric Pressure?</h2>
        <!-- a -->
        <p>A barometric reading that is between the range of 1009.2 and 1022.7 hpa is considered to be normal
          atmospheric
          pressure, which is normally
          associated with steady weather.</p>
        </li>
        <!-- q -->
        <h2>What is Classified as Low Atmospheric Pressure?</h2>
        <!-- a -->
        <p>A barometric reading that is below 1009.2 hpa is considered to be low
          atmospheric
          pressure, which is normally
          associated with warm and rainy weather.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <!-- q -->
          <h2>What does the Humidity Results Report?</h2>
          <!-- a -->
          <p>Humidity measures the amount of water vapor that resides within the air. This can determine the amount of
            moisture. The higher the temperature, the more water vapor the air. Low humidity can make the atmosphere
            dry.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <!-- q -->
          <h2>How do I Read the Results for Wind Direction?</h2>
          <!-- a -->
          <p>The wind direction results are measured in degrees. Depending on the degrees it determines the direction
            where the wind is blowing. The information below contains more details. Note that the cardinal directions
            are your
            typical directions listed on a <a
              href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/61/87/67/618767a83eac4fade619eabf10f3a62a.jpg">compass</a> that contains
            the azimuth degrees, which are simply just the directions measured in degrees clockwise
            starting from the north</p>
